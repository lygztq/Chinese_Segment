Chinese is a language without word boundary.Therefore, Chinese word segmentation is a fundamental task for Chinese Natural Language
Processing(Chinese NLP).Chinese text is different from an alphabetic text,e.g.,an English text,in that it is composed of character strings

NLP tasks such as part-of-speech(POS)tagging, syntactic analysis, semantic analysis are made possible.
